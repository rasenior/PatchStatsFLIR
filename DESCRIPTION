Description: Takes a temperature matrix or raster, such as that returned using 
    the package Thermimage, and finds hot and cold patches. Pixels are matched to 
    these patches, and statistics calculated for pixels and patches. 
    Similarly to Thermimage, this package was written primarily for research 
    purposes in biological applications of gridded temperature data.

Description: Takes a temperature matrix, such as that returned using the package
  Thermimage, and finds hot and cold patches. Pixels are matched to these patches, 
	and statistics calculated for pixels and patches. Similarly to Thermimage, 
	this package was written primarily for research purposes in biological 
	applications of thermal images.

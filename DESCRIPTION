Description: Takes a temperature matrix or raster, such as that returned using 
  the package Thermimage, and finds hot and cold patches. Pixels are matched to 
  these patches, and statistics calculated for pixels and patches. 
  Similarly to Thermimage, this package was written primarily for research 
  purposes in biological applications of gridded temperature data.
